## Abstract

The chromatin activation landscape of major subsets of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with stereotyped B-cell receptor immunoglobulin is currently unknown. Here, we report the results of a whole-genome chromatin profiling of histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation of 21 CLLs from subsets #1, #2, #4, and #8 which were compared against non-stereotyped CLLs and normal B cell subpopulations. Although subsets #1, #2, and #4 did not differ much from their non-stereotyped CLL counterparts, subset #8 displayed a remarkably different chromatin activation profile. In particular, we identified 209 de novo active regulatory elements in this subset versus other CLLs or normal B cells, which showed similar patterns with U-CLLs undergoing Richter transformation. These regions were enriched for binding sites of 9 overexpressed transcription factors. In 78/209 regions, we identified 113 candidate overexpressed target genes, being 14% of regions associated with more than two adjacent genes. These included blocks of up to 7 genes, suggesting a local co-upregulation within the same genome compartment. Our findings further underscore the uniqueness of subset #8 CLLs, notable for the highest risk of Richter’s transformation amongst all CLL, and provide additional clues to decipher the molecular basis of its clinical behavior.
